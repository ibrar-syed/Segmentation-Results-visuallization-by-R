# Visualization/Plotting of Results by using The RStudio.

# GAN Metrics Analysis in R
## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis and visualization of metrics obtained during GAN training. It includes Dice Score and Loss metrics, plotted as line plots, bar charts, and boxplots, as well as multi-panel figures suitable for publication.

## Folder Structure
- `data/raw/` : Original Excel files with metrics.
- `data/processed/` : Processed CSV files generated by the analysis.
- `Scr` : R scripts containing all code.
- `outputs/` : Generated figures and plots.

## Features
- Dice Score evolution across epochs (training vs validation)
- Loss component trends (generator & discriminator)
- Bar charts for final epoch comparison
- Boxplots showing distributions across epochs
- Combined multi-panel figure for publication

## Requirements
- R >= 4.2
- Packages: tidyverse, readxl, patchwork

## Usage
1. Place your raw Excel data in `data/raw/`.
2. Run the analysis script:

```r
source("scripts/analysis.R")
results <- main()
